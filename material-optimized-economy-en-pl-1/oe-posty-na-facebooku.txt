#EconomicGrowth is largely enforced by the lack of durability of manufactured products. It also contributes to the waste of natural resources and environmental degradation.

Man, unlike other species, is by nature a being who actively creates reality. He takes initiatives that, in most cases, organise his activities and are a key condition for continuous development. As a rational being, yet clearly cut off from the influence of instincts, he is condemned to be constantly active in shaping his environment. 

Despite the mistakes made in the development of civilisation, man, thanks to uninterrupted progress, can and should primarily rely on reality created on his own initiative, rather than on spontaneous mechanisms. Reality shows that sooner or later, at some point, he is forced to abandon such solutions in favour of those he has developed himself. This applies to all areas of life, and the area of the economy is no exception.

It is time for a change and to apply a strategy based on the potential of science!

Manufacturers deliberately age their products. The over 100-year-old bulb described below is an example of this. With modification, it would be a great product.

Three levels of the economy 

The economy, due to the fundamental role material goods play in human life, both individually and socially, is a key element of human civilisation.

The most important link in the economy is not the property relations, even though they are the ones that, for historical reasons and human nature, evoke the most emotion and thus focus the most attention on themselves, but the broader strategy of producing material goods.

Meanwhile, the economy over the course of history has become hostage to property relations and the associated numerous, ideologised disputes over economic systems, (including private property versus state property) and economics as such, often becoming an irrational and inefficient means to an end, and sometimes even an end in itself, which should be the development of civilisation and the well-being of the human species.

It is an appropriate, i.e. optimized and thus effective strategy of producing goods based on intellectual potential, or more precisely on broadly understood science: research and development activities, new technologies and investments in these aspects ‚Äì with a special role of the public sector in this respect, also in the context of creating new economic entities ‚Äì and taking into account rationality, social needs, availability of natural resources, environmental conditions or, finally, the very quality of produced goods, that should be the main driving force and the key to achieving prosperity and civilisational success. It is at this level/stage of the economy (LEVEL II in the graphic below) that the greatest opportunities are found.
