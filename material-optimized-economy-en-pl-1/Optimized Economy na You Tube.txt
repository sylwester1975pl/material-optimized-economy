New Economics – Optimized Economy. 
Optimized Economy – An economic model based on the potential of science.

The Optimized Economy is a strategy for the production of goods, based on intellectual potential and, more specifically, on science in the broadest sense of the term, i.e. research and development activities, new technologies and investments in these aspects – with a special role for the public sector in this respect, also in the context of the creation of new economic entities – and taking into account rationality, social needs, the availability of natural resources, environmental conditions or, last but not least, the very quality of the goods produced, which should be the main driving force and the key to achieving prosperity and civilisational success.
